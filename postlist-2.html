<p><strong>Active participation</strong> in the class discussion. Leadership and positive contributions to the class discussion, wherever that takes place. The course hashtag is #hist5702w. (I am <a href="http://twitter.com/electricarchaeo">@electricarchaeo</a> on Twitter). </p>
<p><strong>Open Notebooks</strong>. 9 meeting entries (you are encouraged to make a repository in github just for these), plus 1 session where you lead the group through your experience with a paricular Programming Historian tutorial (these will be assigned). Your posts should/could reflect on the readings, the discussion, and what you learned from the session leader's experience that week. You should also be frequently posting regarding your final project as it develops.If you are working on a <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">Programming Historian</a> tutorial, make a particular note about any hidden 'gotchas' you encounter. Video notes/walk throughs are encouraged; <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com">Screen-cast-o-matic</a> is free, easy to use, and quite effective. You can post these on youtube, vimeo, or similar. If you're on twitter, feel free to tweet the links using the #hist5702w hashtag. <strong>You will select your nine best entries for me to grade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project</strong>: the technologies of video games are an extremely powerful - and perhaps the natural?- form for digital work. The major project in this class will be to explore the issues of digital history as discussed in this course, evidenced through the creation of a playful engagement with the tutorials of <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">the Programming Historian</a>. This can be an individual effort, or a collaborative effort.</p>

<p>You will create digital history through a playful engagement with teaching digital history. </p>

<p><strong>Reflective Short Unessay</strong>. This unessay reflects on the issues of digital history as experienced by the student in the course of completing the major project. Th length and format need only be 'appropriate' and 'compelling'. It can be built into a 'paradata' section to accompany your game. This unessay may be highly personal, and does not necessarily need to be 'written' in a text-forward dead-tree format. For more on ‘unessays’, see <a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay">Daniel O'Donnell</a>. The grading of the project will follow the unessay conventions. We will talk about this.</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to bring your laptop or device to each session.</p>
<h3 id="you-do-not-have-to-work-in-isolation">You do not have to work in isolation</h3>
<p>Digital history can be very frustrating. You don't have to work in isolation. You may collaborate; you can google for solutions; you can ask for advice on Twitter or elsewhere. Make sure, when you <em>do</em> get frustrated (and you will), to just walk away from the computer. There is more than one way to do things digital, and when you're frustrated you won't find <em>any</em> of them. Shut it down, go for a walk, have a coffee. Come back when you're fresh.</p>
<p>But <em>do</em> acknowledge in your work any collaboration or help you have received.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives:</h2>
<p>I've been doing digital archaeology and digital history for over ten years. I still don't know the answer to the questions below, so I look forward to puzzling these out with you over the duration of the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <em>is</em> digital history? </li>
<li>how do we <em>do</em> good digital history?</li>
<li>what is <em>good</em> digital history, anyway?</li>
<li>how do we <em>write</em> history, digitally?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is to say, digital history is sometimes about tools and methods, but other times about theory. Sometimes it is about representation and consumption, and other times about production. I'm pretty sure it decentres the professional historian, but sometimes, it puts us firmly back in the driver's seat. I do know that there are no roads; there might not even be maps.</p>
<p>In which case, we are going to explore these issues as they pertain to Public History. In particular, we are going to learn how to communicate these issues via 'playful' technologies. Some of this will be in the context of a public museum and the implications for the practice of Public History.</p>
<h1 id="final-project-outcome">Final Project Outcome:</h1>
<p>The creation of a major mixed media project with associated digital repository, demonstrating an awareness of the ways digital history can be used to bridge professional practice and the public.</p>
<h2 id="minor-outcomes">Minor outcomes:</h2>
<p>A body of public reflections on the process of doing digital history; a reflection on the entire process of doing the final project that expresses a critical evaluation of the evolution of the student’s engagement with digital history.</p>
<h1 id="digital-identity">Digital Identity</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>An essential part of the life of the scholar […] is your digital identity. How do you present online when people find you through a Google search (as they inevitably will)? What kind of scholar are you? What are your skills? Your interests? Are you an interesting person? Do you take part in debates of consequence? It used to be that outside of our circle of close friends and colleagues, others knew us through our published work. In today’s scholarly ecosystem, we are known by our digital footprint as well as by our “published” work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Mills Kelly</p>
<p>There is a developing ecosystem of digital artefacts that form an increasingly more important part of one’s scholarly persona. You need to think carefully about how you present yourself online, and if you aren’t already doing so, crafting a niche for yourself there. You may wish to obtain a domain name of your own; I would recommend <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a> as a place to start. For the purposes of this course, you will be setting up hosting for your course work via a free account with <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a></p>
<p>Now, make sure you read the sections on <a href="crafting.html">crafting</a>, <a href="openaccess.html">open access workflows</a>, and <a href="futureproof.html">future proofing your research</a>.</p>
