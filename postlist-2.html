<h1 id="open-access-research">Open Access Research</h1>
<p><em>Open access is not simply about putting data online.</em> (A deep discussion about the failings of the techno-utopianism of 'the digital' is <a href="https://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/">Colleen Morgan</a>'s <a href="https://www.academia.edu/2997156/Emancipatory_Digital_Archaeology">phd thesis</a>). Open access means making our data available in <em>useful</em> formats; it means <em>exposing our thought process</em>. It implies transparency in our peer reviews; it demands accountability in our governance. Accordingly, in terms of my teaching, I make not just my readings etc 'open' but also the process of our learning. I require you to make your materials open as well (with caveats; see below). I am open about how I grade - and the criteria we use we develop together. But baby steps, baby steps...</p>
<h2 id="first-step-our-notes">First step: our notes</h2>
<p>As historians, we aren't all that accustomed to sharing our research notes. We go to the archives, we take our photographs, we spend <em>hours</em> pouring over documents, photographs, diaries, newspapers... why should someone else benefit from <em>our</em> work?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why you should want to do this. Read and be prepared to discuss the arguments advanced by these folks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/">Trevor Owens</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html">Caleb McDaniel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/">Ian Milligan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/01/27/why-canadas-open-data-initiative-matters-to-historians/">another post by Milligan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://historymanifesto.cambridge.org/read/chapter-4-big-questions-big-data/">Jo Guldi and David Armitage, ch 4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/11/06/federated-education-new-directions-in-digital-collaboration/">Mike Caulfield</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, <em>change is coming whether historians like it or not</em>. Here in Canada, SSHRC has a <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/about-au_sujet/policies-politiques/statements-enonces/edata-donnees_electroniques-eng.aspx">research data archiving policy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All research data collected with the use of SSHRC funds must be preserved and made available for use by others within a reasonable period of time. SSHRC considers “a reasonable period” to be within two years of the completion of the research project for which the data was collected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932470001897472">conversation that ensued on Twitter after Milligan mentioned all this</a> and also <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932589875101697">here</a></p>
<h2 id="things-to-think-about">Things to think about:</h2>
<ul>
<li>how can we make our research notes open? </li>
<li>what does that implies for how we do research?</li>
<li>how we can use this process to maintain our scholarly voice online?</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, it's also a kind of <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/community-communite/index-eng.aspx#2">'knowledge mobilization'</a>. In the workbook I created for my online undergraduate course on <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/Open-Access-Research/Exercises/">crafting digital history</a> there are exercises on how to use services like <a href="http://dillinger.io">Dillinger.io</a>, <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>, and <a href="http://stackedit.io">Stackedit.io</a> to make changes to a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> file. Feel free to browse or take a copy of that workbook.</p>
<h2 id="split-content-from-container">Split content from container</h2>
<p>First, read Charlie Stross on <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html">Why Microsoft Word Must Die</a>.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">sustainable authorship in plain text using pandoc and markdown</a>. We will be giving this a spin ourselves. Indeed, it is one of my goals for my course that you integrate these approaches into your research process going forwards.</p>
<h1 id="caveats-about-putting-your-stuff-online">Caveats about putting your stuff online</h1>
<p>The online world is not always (or even primarily) a safe space. Open access is not without its dangers, for you personally and academically. We need to talk about these things. </p>
<p>For all public-facing work, you may use a psuedonymn for everything that leaves a trace on the internet, if you so desire. Just let me know who you are! There is value in using your real name, and I strongly suggest you look into reclaiming your digital identity; but what is safe for me as a middle-aged white man to do online is not safe for everyone. You have the right to not have any public facing work at all; should you invoke this right we will arrive at an equitable solution that meets the learning objectives of this course.</p>

<p>Active participation in the class discussion. Leadership and positive contributions to the class discussion, wherever that takes place. The course hashtag is #hist5702w. (I am <a href="http://twitter.com/electricarchaeo">@electricarchaeo</a> on Twitter). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Notebooks. 10 meeting entries (you are encouraged to make a repository in github just for these). For each meeting, half the students will be designated to post a reflection on the readings/tutorials <em>prior</em> to the discussion (that is, to be done by Friday night), and the other half will post a reflection on the class discussion (by Wednesday night). Blog posts will be short and pithy, ca 100-300 words. If you are working on a <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">Programming Historian</a> tutorial, make a particular note about any hidden 'gotchas' you encounter. Video notes/walk throughs are encouraged; <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com">Screen-cast-o-matic</a> is free, easy to use, and quite effective. You can post these on youtube, vimeo, or similar. If you're on twitter, feel free to tweet the links using the #hist5702w hashtag. </p>

<p>Project: the technologies of video games are an extremely powerful - and perhaps the natural?- form for digital work. The major project in this class will be to explore the issues of digital history as discussed in this course, evidenced through the creation of a playful engagement with the tutorials of <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">the Programming Historian</a>. This can be an individual effort, or a collaborative effort.</p>
</li>

<p>You will create digital history through a playful engagement with teaching digital history. </p>

<li>Reflective Short Unessay. This unessay reflects on the issues of digital history as experienced by the student in the course of completing the major project. Th length and format need only be 'appropriate' and 'compelling'. It can be built into a 'paradata' section to accompany your game. This unessay may be highly personal, and does not necessarily need to be 'written' in a text-forward dead-tree format. For more on ‘unessays’, see <a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay">Daniel O'Donnell</a>. The grading of the project will follow the unessay conventions. We will talk about this.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be a good idea to bring your laptop or device to each session.</p>
<h3 id="you-do-not-have-to-work-in-isolation">You do not have to work in isolation</h3>
<p>Digital history can be very frustrating. You don't have to work in isolation. You may collaborate; you can google for solutions; you can ask for advice on Twitter or elsewhere. Make sure, when you <em>do</em> get frustrated (and you will), to just walk away from the computer. There is more than one way to do things digital, and when you're frustrated you won't find <em>any</em> of them. Shut it down, go for a walk, have a coffee. Come back when you're fresh.</p>
<p>But <em>do</em> acknowledge in your work any collaboration or help you have received.</p>
