<h2 id="general-pattern">General pattern</h2>
<p>Each week, we will begin Monday at 9 to allow for childcare arrangements. You are welcome to arrive at 8.30 as per the official schedule, but I will not begin until 9. Consequently, I will also not be stopping for the remainder of the scheduled time. Feel free to bring croissants, coffee, toast, etc. Scrambled eggs are to be avoided as they are messy.</p>
<p>Each week, a designated person will take us through their engagement with a particular <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/">Programming Historian</a> tutorial, as indicated below. There will be readings to support this engagement; I will discuss these individually with you once we divy up the work. Some will highlight uses of the approach, or perhaps issues with the approach, or could've usefully been improved by the approach... or... or... or. I will expect you to <strong>also</strong> clearly articulate connections in other research you've done, read, or courses you're taking/have taken.</p>
<p>(<strong>nb</strong> Even if it's not <em>your</em> week to present, it will be a richer experience if you've given the tutorial a shot as well.)</p>
<p>The remaining time will run along the lines of a mini <a href="http://thatcamp.org">ThatCamp</a>. That is, I expect you to have a sense <em>before class</em> of things you want to work on/discuss/collaborate on. As Thatcamp.org says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>at an unconference, the program isn’t set beforehand: it’s created on the first day with the help of all the participants rather than beforehand by a program committee. Second, at an unconference, there are no presentations — all participants in an unconference are expected to talk and work with fellow participants in every session. An unconference is to a conference what a seminar is to a lecture; going to an unconference is like being a member of an improv troupe whereas going to a conference is (mostly) like being a member of an audience. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've had far too many seminars that felt like dreadful dreadful conferences. So, let's give this a try. One thing that I think I would like you to discuss <strong>every</strong> session: how does this particular tutorial move us closer to the final project goal? What could we do with this? How can we open this thing up even mmore?</p>
<p>These sessions will be opportunities for the more techy to help the less, for the more theoretically inclined to help the more methodologically inclined. I will say this though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>doing</strong> embodies theories of <strong>knowing</strong> and how you do things reveals what you know. So know what you're doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sequence of lessons we will go through mirrors the progression of a digital history research project - setting up your environment/project/workflow; data capture; data munging; analysis; visualizations; public consumption.</p>
<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<h4 id="january-11">January 11:</h4>
<p><strong>Because of an MA examination in which I am participating and cannot reschedule</strong>, this session will be led by Mr. Rob Blades and Mr. Shawn Anctil. Rob will help you set up your online notebooks, which are required in this class, as well as your github accounts. Rob and Shawn have worked on many digital projects, some with me, and they can give you an honest accounting of what I am like to work with, and how I tend to work. I would ask also that you take the opportunity to discuss as a class the course website and syllabus materials; Shawn A will moderate this discussion. As a class, I would like you to collaboratively come up with a list of </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>- the things you like concerning the course plan, 
- the things that concern you, 
- and the things where you feel you need more information. 
- a general sense of where the class is, technologically - a census of operating systems &amp; experience.

- no names need be attached. Rob will give me this list and I can address them at the subsequent meeting.</code></pre>


<p>I appreciate that starting the course without me present might feel a bit odd, but I feel that without me the conversation you would have about those issues will be more genuine and useful. I thank you in advance for your flexibility on this matter. As one of the few people around who can examine digital MA work, I am sometimes not able to schedule things as I would like.</p>
<h4 id="january-18">January 18:</h4>
<p>Discussion of the concerns voiced in the previous meeting. Confirmation that everyone's open notebook is set up and that we understand what is required, and how things will roll out. Earlier in the year, <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/highschoolhistorygaming">I set up a project</a> for a class of high school history students in Ottawa. In the context of the resources I listed under the <a href="final-project.html">final project page</a> we will play these games and discuss what the students have done well, and what 'could have been even better if...'. </p>
<p>We will attempt to define for ourselves the hallmarks of good history through this particular medium, as evidenced by these games (and others you may know). I hope to have Sean Tudor from the Canada Science and Technology Museum visit with us to discuss that earlier moment in video game history, when games were text based but transgressed media. These lessons we will apply to our final project.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Doc-Brown-Martin-Casanova.jpg" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="left"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Where we're going, we don't need roads</em>. (Brown, 1985)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives:</h2>
<p>I've been doing digital archaeology and digital history for over ten years. I still don't know the answer to the questions below, so I look forward to puzzling these out with you over the duration of the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <em>is</em> digital history? </li>
<li>how do we <em>do</em> good digital history?</li>
<li>what is <em>good</em> digital history, anyway?</li>
<li>how do we <em>write</em> history, digitally?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is to say, digital history is sometimes about tools and methods, but other times about theory. Sometimes it is about representation and consumption, and other times about production. I'm pretty sure it decentres the professional historian, but sometimes, it puts us firmly back in the driver's seat. I do know that there are no roads; there might not even be maps.</p>
<p>In which case, we are going to explore these issues as they pertain to Public History. In particular, we are going to learn how to communicate these issues via 'playful' technologies. Some of this will be in the context of a public museum and the implications for the practice of Public History.</p>
<h1 id="final-project-outcome">Final Project Outcome:</h1>
<p>The <a href="final-project.html">creation of a major mixed media project</a> with associated digital repository, demonstrating an awareness of the ways digital history can be used to bridge professional practice and the public.</p>
<h2 id="minor-outcomes">Minor outcomes:</h2>
<p>A body of public reflections on the process of doing digital history; a reflection on the entire process of doing the final project that expresses a critical evaluation of the evolution of the student’s engagement with digital history.</p>
<h1 id="digital-identity">Digital Identity</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>An essential part of the life of the scholar […] is your digital identity. How do you present online when people find you through a Google search (as they inevitably will)? What kind of scholar are you? What are your skills? Your interests? Are you an interesting person? Do you take part in debates of consequence? It used to be that outside of our circle of close friends and colleagues, others knew us through our published work. In today’s scholarly ecosystem, we are known by our digital footprint as well as by our “published” work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Mills Kelly</p>
<p>There is a developing ecosystem of digital artefacts that form an increasingly more important part of one’s scholarly persona. You need to think carefully about how you present yourself online, and if you aren’t already doing so, crafting a niche for yourself there. You may wish to obtain a domain name of your own; I would recommend <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a> as a place to start. For the purposes of this course, you will be setting up hosting for your course work via a free account with <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a></p>
