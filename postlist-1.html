<p>Before you go any further, I would like you to play two pieces of 'ergodic' literature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buried, by Tara Copplestone &amp; Luke Botham (<a href="http://www.taracopplestone.co.uk/buriedindex.html">blog post</a>|<a href="http://www.taracopplestone.co.uk/buried.html">game</a>). This, and the others, might take a moment to load. Be patient.</li>
<li>Beneath Floes, by Bravemule (<a href="http://www.bravemule.com/beneathfloes">info</a>|<a href="http://www.bravemule.com/storage/beneath-floes/beneathfloes.html">game</a>)</li>
<li>Queers in Love at the End of the World, by Anna Anthropy (<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=2205">info</a>|<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">game</a>)</li>
<li>Depression Quest, by Zoe Quinn (<a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">info</a>|<a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html">game</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>How do these pieces achieve their aims? How do you feel as you play them? What - and how - do you learn? What do these games <em>do</em> to you? Each is trying to get you to see the world from a different perspective; all of them feature player characters that you do not see in the main stream. Indeed, I've always felt that in some ways, in AAA titles, the graphics get in the way. Imagine if the computing power of all your processors, all your cores, was devoted to representing human interactions rather than blood, gore, and amazing athletic abilities (for more on this, see <a href="https://github.com/ryanpickering/honours-research-project/tree/master/updates">Ryan Pickering's undergrad BA thesis work</a>)?</p>
<p>These four pieces are all very different, but each one of them is affecting, moving, and indeed, are art. They were all built using <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>. At its core, Twine allows the construction of branching narratives through hyperlinked pieces of text. (You can even hack Twine to allow your story passages to be triggered by your geographical location! <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/Hacking%20Twine%20to%20make%20a%20location-based%20game.md">see this</a>). In its simplicity, it harkens back to the origins of video gaming, the Interactive Fiction.</p>
<p>In the early days of video gaming, one way of trying to combat piracy was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelie">'the feelie'</a>, an actual physical artefact of some kind upon which progress in the game depended. It might be that you had for instance the <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2009/07/08/the-grail-diary/">grail diary</a>, and a character in the game would demand to know where you'd been on June 25 1936. If you didn't have the physical object, you couldn't answer the question, and the game would shut down.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-i-want-you-to-do">This is what I want you to do.</h2>
<p><img src="/uploads/doge-meta.png" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="left"><a href="http://programminghistorian.org">The Programming Historian</a> is your 'feelie', your physical object, that you will tie into an immersive, engaging experience. That is to say, you are going to build, using the tools of gaming, a work of digital history that simultaneously explores, comments, critiques, or teaches, digital history.</p>
<p>I'd suggest you begin with Twine, although there are <em>many</em> other options out there, up to and including <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/readme.md">augmented reality and virtual reality</a>. I have an Oculus Rift if anybody has the coding chops and can see a way to make that work for what I want you to do.</p>
<p>There are other platforms that can be played with. I could imagine using <a href="http://omeka.org">Omeka</a> and <a href="http://neatline.org">Neatline</a> somehow as a kind of game board with riddles and puzzles, for instance. Perhaps <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> as a kind of Ovid-in-Dante's-Inferno guide. Youtube videos can be annotated with links. There are many possibilities. (Once upon a time there was something called <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2008/03/14/pmoging-internet-research-skills/">'PMOG'</a> that held enormous promise. I still think the example is worth considering.)</p>

<h2 id="how-and-what-you-will-submit">How - and what - you will submit</h2>
<p>You will need to create a repository in github into which you will keep your notes, your research, art work, etc. Make sure to have a Readme.md file in there that indicates the appropriate license or copyright on your materials. Make sure you also have a document in there (bibtex file, or other) for your citations and sources. If you go with a twine project, you can put the playable file into a gh-pages branch and serve it that way; another option might be <a href="http://philome.la/">Philome.la</a> (I once did a <a href="http://philome.la/electricarchaeo/hist3812a-videogames-for-historians">syllabus</a> this way). If you go some other route, please keep me abreast of developments and let me know what's going on. You will send me a progress report at the end of Winter Reading week (this can be an email, just telling me what's going on).</p>
<p>You will submit this (or whatever you have) by the second last week of term. This will give us time to play each other's games, and have one last discussion about what worked and what didn't.</p>

<h1 id="future-proofing-your-research">Future Proofing Your Research</h1>
<p>Back in 2003, Roy Rosenzweig wrote <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=6">Scarcity or Abundance? Preserving the Past in a Digital Era</a>. Roy saw that the seeming abundance of historical materials online was illusory, that without proper training and funding, we would <em>lose</em> materials. If anything <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/the-irony-of-writing-about-digital-preservation/416184/">things have gotten worse</a>. However, there are important projects afoot that are trying to address this memory pit - projects like <a href="http://webarchives.ca/about">'Web Archives'</a> and <a href="https://archive.org">The Internet Archive</a>. Google around the Internet Archive though and you'll find that there are concerns. Recently, Scott Weingart wrote about the Shoah Digital Archive, and the ways the <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=41498">physicality of digital preservation can continue violence against the dead</a>. </p>
<p>But let's dial back a bit. What about our personal research?</p>
<h2 id="bricks">Bricks</h2>
<p><img src="/uploads/burntcomputer.jpg" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="right">
I wrote my PhD from 1999 - 2002. I had a Toshiba laptop. I backed everything up onto iOmega zip drives. I was cutting edge, baby. One day, the screen on the laptop completely fritzed out. No problem; the laptop had a serial port, and I wired it up to a 17" (17 inches from about 8 before - this was <em>major</em>!) cathod-ray-tube monitor. Then the keys got too sticky with gunk, so I plugged in an external keyboard. My FrankenSystem got me through the PhD. </p>
<p>Then, things changed. USB was invented. My life took me away from academia for a while. When I came back, and wanted my files, they were trapped - the 3.5" drive I had still worked, but none of my current machines had 3.5" drives. The woman from tech support managed to free the contents of my hard drive, and put them onto a cd-rom for me. All of my data was in dbase files; my writing was in .wpd files, and the graphics were in some format that used an unrecognizable file extension.</p>
<p>What was worse, this was just what I <em>remembered</em>. I couldn't actually read my data because it was encrypted and compressed to save space on the harddrive, using some Microsoft utility that was discontinued in '99, and I couldn't solve this problem.</p>
<p>Physical bricks, digital bricks: my data was all more or less lost. Only the stuff I published as <em>tables</em> at the appendix of my <em>printed</em> thesis survived, because I was able to OCR them and copy the data into Excel. (I did find some Excel files I made, but they were just awful, awful.)</p>
<h2 id="backups-and-security">Backups and security</h2>
<p>I invite you to read how I lost the <a href="electricarchaeology.ca/2012/05/18/how-i-lost-the-crowd-a-tale-of-sorrow-and-hope/">HeritageCrowd Project</a>. There, I built a horribly complicated system to encourage crowdsourced memories about the area. Because the site allowed user input forms connected to my database, robots (! - not even humans) were able to take down my site by first, abusing it to try to sell Viagra, and secondly, recognizing the site was compromised and taking it off line.</p>
<p><em>Poof</em></p>
<p>Work all gone. (Silver lining: an automatic backup of the mysql database was recovered). </p>
<h2 id="the-lesson">The lesson</h2>
<p>Two cautionary tales: hardware backups are only as good as they are current technology; writers of digital history need to be aware that there are other active agents involved. The other thing to observe concerns the technology that <em>did</em> work, printed paper. Paper has a lot going for it. It's a low-level tech in that reading it involves only being able to see it (whether or not you can read the language is a function of script as a technology, and the culture of teaching and social values in which you are embedded). For we digital historians, the lessons are this.</p>
<ol>
<li>have a backup and versioning strategy that transcends the hardware you happen to work with</li>
<li>keep your data in as simple a format as possible - human readable, able to be printed cleanly if necessary, and (most importanlty) able to be read by any computer now and into the future. That is to say: write your text in plain text (txt or md files), and keep your data in plain text as well (that might mean a table where commas separate the values - csv - or tabs - tsv).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we start figuring out our own personal futureproofing issues, we can begin to scale back up to the online world in general.</p>
<h1 id="needful-things">Needful things</h1>
<p>You will need then a text editor. Any of the default notepads or wordpads that come with your machine are not good enough (in most cases) because they still embed hidden typographic codes etc in your text. Download, and install either <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. The next part of your toolkit is <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>. Download and install it. Finally, go to <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> and sign up for an account. Download and install Github's desktop client.</p>
<p>You will be astonished at the things you can do with a simple text editor and pandoc, with an online repository in which to host things. </p>
<p>As you progress through this course, you will end up adding to this basic toolkit. About time we started using these wonderful machines for things more than cat videos, eh?</p>
<p>(By the way, get <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com/">Screen-cast-o-matic</a>. A quick video to share when things are going wrong does wonders for resolving stuff quickly).</p>
