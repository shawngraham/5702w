<blockquote>
<p><em>Where we're going, we don't need roads</em>. (Brown, 1985)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives:</h2>
<p>I've been doing digital archaeology and digital history for over ten years. I still don't know the answer to a few questions, and our objectives for the course are to move us closer to some answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <em>is</em> digital history? </li>
<li>how do we <em>do</em> good digital history?</li>
<li>what is <em>good</em> digital history, anyway?</li>
<li>how do we <em>write</em> history, digitally?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is to say, digital history is sometimes about tools and methods, but other times about theory. Sometimes it is about representation and consumption, and other times about production. I'm pretty sure it decentres the professional historian, but sometimes, it puts us firmly back in the driver's seat. I do know that there are no roads; there might not even be maps.</p>
<p>In which case, we are going to explore these issues as they pertain to Public History. In particular, we are going to learn how to communicate these issues via 'playful' technologies. Some of this will be in the context of a public museum and the implications for the practice of Public History.</p>
<h1 id="final-project-outcome">Final Project Outcome:</h1>
<p>The creation of a major mixed media project with associated online digital repository, demonstrating an awareness of the ways digital history can be used to bridge professional practice and the public.</p>
<h2 id="minor-outcomes">Minor outcomes:</h2>
<p>A body of public reflections on the process of doing digital history; a reflection on the entire process of doing the final project that expresses a critical evaluation of the evolution of the student’s engagement with digital history.</p>
<h1 id="digital-identity">Digital Identity</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>An essential part of the life of the scholar […] is your digital identity. How do you present online when people find you through a Google search (as they inevitably will)? What kind of scholar are you? What are your skills? Your interests? Are you an interesting person? Do you take part in debates of consequence? It used to be that outside of our circle of close friends and colleagues, others knew us through our published work. In today’s scholarly ecosystem, we are known by our digital footprint as well as by our “published” work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Mills Kelly</p>
<p>There is a developing ecosystem of digital artefacts that form an increasingly more important part of one’s scholarly persona. You need to think carefully about how you present yourself online, and if you aren’t already doing so, crafting a niche for yourself there. You may wish to obtain a domain name of your own; I would recommend <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a> as a place to start. For the purposes of this course, you will be setting up hosting for your course work via a free account with <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a></p>

<h1 id="open-access-research">Open Access Research</h1>
<p>As historians, we aren't all that accustomed to sharing our research notes. We go to the archives, we take our photographs, we spend <em>hours</em> pouring over documents, photographs, diaries, newspapers... why should someone else benefit from <em>our</em> work?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why you should want to do this. Read and be prepared to discuss the arguments advanced by these folks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/">Trevor Owens</a></li>

<li><a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/">Ian Milligan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/01/27/why-canadas-open-data-initiative-matters-to-historians/">another post by Milligan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://historymanifesto.cambridge.org/read/chapter-4-big-questions-big-data/">Jo Guldi and David Armitage, ch 4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/11/06/federated-education-new-directions-in-digital-collaboration/">Mike Caulfield</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, <em>change is coming whether historians like it or not</em>. Here in Canada, SSHRC has a <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/about-au_sujet/policies-politiques/statements-enonces/edata-donnees_electroniques-eng.aspx">research data archiving policy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All research data collected with the use of SSHRC funds must be preserved and made available for use by others within a reasonable period of time. SSHRC considers “a reasonable period” to be within two years of the completion of the research project for which the data was collected.</p>

<p>Note the <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932470001897472">conversation that ensued on Twitter after Milligan mentioned all this</a> and also <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932589875101697">here</a></p>
<h2 id="things-to-think-about">Things to think about:</h2>
<ul>
<li>how can we make our research notes open? </li>
<li>what does that implies for how we do research?</li>
<li>how we can use this process to maintain our scholarly voice online?</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, it's also a kind of <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/community-communite/index-eng.aspx#2">'knowledge mobilization'</a>. In the workbook I created for my online undergraduate course on <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/Open-Access-Research/Exercises/">crafting digital history</a> there are exercises on how to use services like <a href="http://dillinger.io">Dillinger.io</a>, <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>, and <a href="http://stackedit.io">Stackedit.io</a> to make changes to a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> file. Really, it's about <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">sustainable authorship</a>. </p>
