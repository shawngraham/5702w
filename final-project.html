<p>Before you go any further, I would like you to play some pieces of 'ergodic' literature ('ergodic' in that they take work to 'read'):</p>
<ul>
<li>Buried, by Tara Copplestone &amp; Luke Botham (<a href="http://www.taracopplestone.co.uk/buriedindex.html">blog post</a>|<a href="http://www.taracopplestone.co.uk/buried.html">game</a>). This, and the others, might take a moment to load. Be patient.</li>
<li>Beneath Floes, by Bravemule (<a href="http://www.bravemule.com/beneathfloes">info</a>|<a href="http://www.bravemule.com/storage/beneath-floes/beneathfloes.html">game</a>)</li>
<li>Queers in Love at the End of the World, by Anna Anthropy (<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=2205">info</a>|<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">game</a>)</li>
<li>Depression Quest, by Zoe Quinn (<a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">info</a>|<a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html">game</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>How do these pieces achieve their aims? How do you feel as you play them? What - and how - do you learn? What do these games <em>do</em> to you? Each is trying to get you to see the world from a different perspective; all of them feature player characters that you do not see in the main stream. Indeed, I've always felt that in some ways, in AAA titles, the graphics get in the way. Imagine if the computing power of all your processors, all your cores, was devoted to representing human interactions rather than blood, gore, and amazing athletic abilities (for more on this, see <a href="https://github.com/ryanpickering/honours-research-project/tree/master/updates">Ryan Pickering's undergrad BA thesis work</a>)?</p>
<p>These four pieces are all very different, but each one of them is affecting, moving, and indeed, are art. They were all built using <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>. At its core, Twine allows the construction of branching narratives through hyperlinked pieces of text. (You can even hack Twine to allow your story passages to be triggered by your geographical location! <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/Hacking%20Twine%20to%20make%20a%20location-based%20game.md">see this</a>). In its simplicity, it harkens back to the origins of video gaming, the Interactive Fiction.</p>
<p>In the early days of video gaming, one way of trying to combat piracy was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelie">'the feelie'</a>, an actual physical artefact of some kind upon which progress in the game depended. It might be that you had for instance the <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2009/07/08/the-grail-diary/">grail diary</a>, and a character in the game would demand to know where you'd been on June 25 1936. If you didn't have the physical object, you couldn't answer the question, and the game would shut down.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-i-want-you-to-do">This is what I want you to do.</h2>
<p><img src="/uploads/doge-meta.png" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="left"><a href="http://programminghistorian.org">The Programming Historian</a> is your 'feelie', your physical object, that you will tie into an immersive, engaging experience. That is to say, you are going to build, using the tools of gaming, a work of digital history that simultaneously explores, comments, critiques, or teaches, digital history.</p>
<p>I'd suggest you begin with Twine, although there are <em>many</em> other options out there, up to and including <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/readme.md">augmented reality and virtual reality</a>. I have an Oculus Rift if anybody has the coding chops and can see a way to make that work for what I want you to do.</p>
<p>There are other platforms that can be played with. I could imagine using <a href="http://omeka.org">Omeka</a> and <a href="http://neatline.org">Neatline</a> somehow as a kind of game board with riddles and puzzles, for instance. Perhaps <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> as a kind of Ovid-in-Dante's-Inferno guide. Youtube videos can be annotated with links. There are many possibilities. (Once upon a time there was something called <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2008/03/14/pmoging-internet-research-skills/">'PMOG'</a> that held enormous promise. I still think the example is worth considering.)</p>

<p>I think you might need some grounding. Things to read (in no discernable citation style, and in no particular order):</p>

<p>...indeed, I have a bunch of resources/things I've written on games <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/11/19/teaching-history-inwithvia-video-games/">here</a> which you may or may not find useful.</p>
<h2 id="how-and-what-you-will-submit">How - and what - you will submit</h2>
<p>You will need to create a repository in github into which you will keep your notes, your research, art work, etc. Make sure to have a Readme.md file in there that indicates the appropriate license or copyright on your materials. Make sure you also have a document in there (bibtex file, or other) for your citations and sources. If you go with a twine project, you can put the playable file into a gh-pages branch and serve it that way; another option might be <a href="http://philome.la/">Philome.la</a> (I once did a <a href="http://philome.la/electricarchaeo/hist3812a-videogames-for-historians">syllabus</a> this way). If you go some other route, please keep me abreast of developments and let me know what's going on. You will send me a progress report at the end of Winter Reading week (this can be an email, just telling me what's going on).</p>
<p>You will submit this (or whatever you have) by the second last week of term. This will give us time to play each other's games, and have one last discussion about what worked and what didn't.</p>
