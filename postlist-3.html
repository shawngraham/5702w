<p>Before you go any further, I would like you to play some pieces of 'ergodic' literature ('ergodic' in that they take work to 'read'):</p>
<ul>
<li>Buried, by Tara Copplestone &amp; Luke Botham (<a href="http://www.taracopplestone.co.uk/buriedindex.html">blog post</a>|<a href="http://www.taracopplestone.co.uk/buried.html">game</a>). This, and the others, might take a moment to load. Be patient.</li>
<li>Beneath Floes, by Bravemule (<a href="http://www.bravemule.com/beneathfloes">info</a>|<a href="http://www.bravemule.com/storage/beneath-floes/beneathfloes.html">game</a>)</li>
<li>Queers in Love at the End of the World, by Anna Anthropy (<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=2205">info</a>|<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">game</a>)</li>
<li>Depression Quest, by Zoe Quinn (<a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">info</a>|<a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html">game</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>How do these pieces achieve their aims? How do you feel as you play them? What - and how - do you learn? What do these games <em>do</em> to you? Each is trying to get you to see the world from a different perspective; all of them feature player characters that you do not see in the main stream. Indeed, I've always felt that in some ways, in AAA titles, the graphics get in the way. Imagine if the computing power of all your processors, all your cores, was devoted to representing human interactions rather than blood, gore, and amazing athletic abilities (for more on this, see <a href="https://github.com/ryanpickering/honours-research-project/tree/master/updates">Ryan Pickering's undergrad BA thesis work</a>)?</p>
<p>These four pieces are all very different, but each one of them is affecting, moving, and indeed, are art. They were all built using <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>. At its core, Twine allows the construction of branching narratives through hyperlinked pieces of text. (You can even hack Twine to allow your story passages to be triggered by your geographical location! <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/Hacking%20Twine%20to%20make%20a%20location-based%20game.md">see this</a>). In its simplicity, it harkens back to the origins of video gaming, the Interactive Fiction.</p>
<p>In the early days of video gaming, one way of trying to combat piracy was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelie">'the feelie'</a>, an actual physical artefact of some kind upon which progress in the game depended. It might be that you had for instance the <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2009/07/08/the-grail-diary/">grail diary</a>, and a character in the game would demand to know where you'd been on June 25 1936. If you didn't have the physical object, you couldn't answer the question, and the game would shut down.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-i-want-you-to-do">This is what I want you to do.</h2>
<p><img src="/uploads/doge-meta.png" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="left"><a href="http://programminghistorian.org">The Programming Historian</a> is your 'feelie', your physical object, that you will tie into an immersive, engaging experience. That is to say, you are going to build, using the tools of gaming, a work of digital history that simultaneously explores, comments, critiques, or teaches, digital history.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-twine">Start with Twine</h3>
<p>I'd suggest you begin with Twine, although there are <em>many</em> other options out there, up to and including <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/ar-archaeology/blob/master/workshop%20materials/readme.md">augmented reality and virtual reality</a>. I have an Oculus Rift if anybody has the coding chops and can see a way to make that work for what I want you to do.</p>
<p>There are other platforms that can be played with. I could imagine using <a href="http://omeka.org">Omeka</a> and <a href="http://neatline.org">Neatline</a> somehow as a kind of game board with riddles and puzzles, for instance. Perhaps <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> as a kind of Ovid-in-Dante's-Inferno guide. Youtube videos can be annotated with links. There are many possibilities. (Once upon a time there was something called <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2008/03/14/pmoging-internet-research-skills/">'PMOG'</a> that held enormous promise. I still think the example is worth considering.)</p>

<p>...indeed, I have a bunch of resources/things I've written on games <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/11/19/teaching-history-inwithvia-video-games/">here</a> which you may or may not find useful.</p>
<h2 id="how-and-what-you-will-submit">How - and what - you will submit</h2>
<p>You will need to create a repository in github into which you will keep your notes, your research, art work, etc. Make sure to have a Readme.md file in there that indicates the appropriate license or copyright on your materials. Make sure you also have a document in there (bibtex file, or other) for your citations and sources. If you go with a twine project, you can put the playable file into a gh-pages branch and serve it that way; another option might be <a href="http://philome.la/">Philome.la</a> (I once did a <a href="http://philome.la/electricarchaeo/hist3812a-videogames-for-historians">syllabus</a> this way). If you go some other route, please keep me abreast of developments and let me know what's going on. You will send me a progress report at the end of Winter Reading week (this can be an email, just telling me what's going on).</p>
<p>You will submit this (or whatever you have) by the second last week of term. Send me the URL. This will give us time to play each other's games, and have one last discussion about what worked and what didn't.</p>

<p><strong>Active participation</strong> in the class discussion. Leadership and positive contributions to the class discussion, wherever that takes place. The course hashtag is #hist5702w. (I am <a href="http://twitter.com/electricarchaeo">@electricarchaeo</a> on Twitter). Each week will involve one or two students giving us a warts-and-all post-mortem on a programming historian tutorial. You will reflect on how this tutorial intersects with your other courses, your own research, and indeed, the few readings that I will provide you (I expect you to follow through links to bibliography and so on in the tutorials and to bring those to bear in the conversation). If you are not leading the post-mortem, I still expect you to be familiar with the tutorial, the associated links and so on so that we can have a productive conversation. Each session will involve hacking, poking, prodding, and otherwise <em>doing</em> digital history. It'll be equal parts yack and hack, as it were. We can spend time every session considering how all of this will play to the final project as well.</p>
<p><strong>Open Notebooks</strong>. 9 meeting entries (you are encouraged to make a repository in github just for these), plus 1 session where you lead the group through your experience with a paricular Programming Historian tutorial (these will be assigned). Your posts should/could reflect on the readings, the discussion, and what you learned from the session leader's experience that week. You should also be frequently posting regarding your final project as it develops.If you are working on a <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">Programming Historian</a> tutorial, make a particular note about any hidden 'gotchas' you encounter. Video notes/walk throughs are encouraged; <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com">Screen-cast-o-matic</a> is free, easy to use, and quite effective. You can post these on youtube, vimeo, or similar. If you're on twitter, feel free to tweet the links using the #hist5702w hashtag. <strong>You will select your nine best entries for me to grade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project</strong>: the technologies of video games are an extremely powerful - and perhaps the natural?- form for digital work. The major project in this class will be to explore the issues of digital history as discussed in this course, evidenced through the creation of a playful engagement with the tutorials of <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">the Programming Historian</a>. This can be an individual effort, or a collaborative effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will create digital history through a playful engagement with teaching digital history. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflective Short Unessay</strong>. This unessay reflects on the issues of digital history as experienced by the student in the course of completing the major project. Th length and format need only be 'appropriate' and 'compelling'. It can be built into a 'paradata' section to accompany your game. This unessay may be highly personal, and does not necessarily need to be 'written' in a text-forward dead-tree format. For more on ‘unessays’, see <a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay">Daniel O'Donnell</a>. The grading of the project and the reflective essay will follow the unessay conventions. We will talk about this.</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to bring your laptop or device to each session.</p>
<h3 id="you-do-not-have-to-work-in-isolation">You do not have to work in isolation</h3>
<p>Digital history can be very frustrating. You don't have to work in isolation. You may collaborate; you can google for solutions; you can ask for advice on Twitter or elsewhere. Make sure, when you <em>do</em> get frustrated (and you will), to just walk away from the computer. There is more than one way to do things digital, and when you're frustrated you won't find <em>any</em> of them. Shut it down, go for a walk, have a coffee. Come back when you're fresh.</p>
<p>But <em>do</em> acknowledge in your work any collaboration or help you have received. Failure to acknowledge help received will be regarded like a failure to cite.</p>
