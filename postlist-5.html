<p><img src="/uploads/inspiration.png" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="left">Great art comes from inspiration. Technical skill, yes of course. But 'inspiration' - the divine breath. Science? Science requires hard work and graft. Careful observation, attention to detail, replication, routine and method. Carefully record everything, and someone else could (should be able to) replicate it. Yes, there is insight and eureka moments, but we can agree that art and science are at different points along the continuum. So what of craft? I know a man who is astonishingly good at wood working. He will stand there, quietly, while he contemplates a piece of wood. Then, without a word, he begins to work with it. He sees the grain, and can feel how the piece is going to go. The materials can be guided, but they push him as much as he pushes them. The resulting piece can be typed - 'Oh, you make a shaker-style chair' - but, in its own quiet way, it is unique. </p>
<p><img src="/uploads/handknittedlaptop.jpg" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px"align="left">To my mind, digital history sits in the realm of craft. Maybe digital history is at the midway point on the continuum between art and science. Or maybe 'craftiness' is just another axis, and there are a landscape of possible configurations in the x,y,z space of art/science/craft. In any event, there is no recipe I can give you that will enable you to 'do' digital history. Sure, I can show you how to topic model, and you can run data through it like grist through a mill, but that's not to say that the result is meaningful. The craft of digital history lies in knowing <em>which</em> techniques work best with <em>what</em> materials - and in knowing when to go against the grain. It lies in producing sometimes beatiful unique pieces that bring out a greater truth, that stand on their own. At other times, it involves quietly producing the one piece that fits perfectly into the larger argument.</p>
<p>My own practice lately has been blurring between visualization/sonification and sound art. I'm hoping that over the course of this term, you will find your own crafty corner of digital history to call your own. It will change with time, practice, and exposure to digital media and ways of representing the past. What was hard becomes easier (and at the same time, less examined at a theoretical level), the goal posts move, and the latest digital toy appears on the horizon. But you will be equipped to evaluate, incorporate, ignore, as needs arise.</p>
<h2 id="questions-to-start-with-do-i-need-to-be-techy">Questions to start with: do I need to be techy?</h2>
<p>How do we find, analyze, and visualize the patterns in historical data? Is the internet a historical source? How do people talk about history online? Is Google changing our historical consciousness? What happens when people off-load their historical memory to Wikipedia? How do we regain control over our digital identity as historians? What does open access research mean for me?</p>
<p>Crafting Digital History explores these questions and more over the term through a series of hands-on exercises and project work. You do not need to be ‘techy’ to succeed in this course. I know that digital skills come in all shapes and sizes - I grade how far you've <em>come</em>, not where you <strong>get to</strong>. What is far more important than being 'techy' is that you are willing to try, and willing to say ‘I don’t know – help?’ I expect you to talk to each other in this class. Share your work. Collaborate. Help each other!</p>
<p>I sometimes talk about 'failing in public'. That is to say, we talk about and critically examine the things that work, and the things that didn't. 'Fail' in this context doesn't mean the end of the road: rather it's just one stage in a productive cycle of learning, experimenting, and community building that makes digital history one of the most exciting fields to work in.</p>

<h1 id="open-access-research">Open Access Research</h1>
<p><em>Open access is not simply about putting data online.</em> (A deep discussion about the failings of the techno-utopianism of 'the digital' is <a href="https://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/">Colleen Morgan</a>'s <a href="https://www.academia.edu/2997156/Emancipatory_Digital_Archaeology">phd thesis</a>). Open access means making our data available in <em>useful</em> formats; it means <em>exposing our thought process</em>. It implies transparency in our peer reviews; it demands accountability in our governance. Accordingly, in terms of my teaching, I make not just my readings etc 'open' but also the process of our learning. I require you to make your materials open as well (with caveats; see below). I am open about how I grade - and the criteria we use we develop together. But baby steps, baby steps...</p>
<h2 id="first-step-our-notes">First step: our notes</h2>
<p>As historians, we aren't all that accustomed to sharing our research notes. We go to the archives, we take our photographs, we spend <em>hours</em> pouring over documents, photographs, diaries, newspapers... why should someone else benefit from <em>our</em> work?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why you should want to do this. Read and be prepared to discuss the arguments advanced by these folks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/">Trevor Owens</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html">Caleb McDaniel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/">Ian Milligan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/01/27/why-canadas-open-data-initiative-matters-to-historians/">another post by Milligan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://historymanifesto.cambridge.org/read/chapter-4-big-questions-big-data/">Jo Guldi and David Armitage, ch 4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/11/06/federated-education-new-directions-in-digital-collaboration/">Mike Caulfield</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, <em>change is coming whether historians like it or not</em>. Here in Canada, SSHRC has a <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/about-au_sujet/policies-politiques/statements-enonces/edata-donnees_electroniques-eng.aspx">research data archiving policy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All research data collected with the use of SSHRC funds must be preserved and made available for use by others within a reasonable period of time. SSHRC considers “a reasonable period” to be within two years of the completion of the research project for which the data was collected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932470001897472">conversation that ensued on Twitter after Milligan mentioned all this</a> and also <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932589875101697">here</a></p>
<h2 id="things-to-think-about">Things to think about:</h2>
<ul>
<li>how can we make our research notes open? </li>
<li>what does that implies for how we do research?</li>
<li>how we can use this process to maintain our scholarly voice online?</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, it's also a kind of <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/community-communite/index-eng.aspx#2">'knowledge mobilization'</a>. In the workbook I created for my online undergraduate course on <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/Open-Access-Research/Exercises/">crafting digital history</a> there are exercises on how to use services like <a href="http://dillinger.io">Dillinger.io</a>, <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>, and <a href="http://stackedit.io">Stackedit.io</a> to make changes to a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> file. Feel free to browse or take a copy of that workbook.</p>
<h2 id="split-content-from-container">Split content from container</h2>
<p>First, read Charlie Stross on <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html">Why Microsoft Word Must Die</a>.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">sustainable authorship in plain text using pandoc and markdown</a>. We will be giving this a spin ourselves. Indeed, it is one of my goals for my course that you integrate these approaches into your research process going forwards.</p>
<h1 id="caveats-about-putting-your-stuff-online">Caveats about putting your stuff online</h1>
<p>The online world is not always (or even primarily) a safe space. Open access is not without its dangers, for you personally and academically. We need to talk about these things. </p>
<p>For all public-facing work, you may use a psuedonymn for everything that leaves a trace on the internet, if you so desire. Just let me know who you are! There is value in using your real name, and I strongly suggest you look into reclaiming your digital identity; but what is safe for me as a middle-aged white man to do online is not safe for everyone. You have the right to not have any public facing work at all; should you invoke this right we will arrive at an equitable solution that meets the learning objectives of this course.</p>
